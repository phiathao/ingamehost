                        "text": "Behavioral Rules\n  - Ensure all explorer notes, obelisks, cave entrances, artifacts, runes, and charge nodes are accessible, do not block them. You may put structures down before you run the cave but remove it afterwards.\n  - Use common courtesy and be respectful to fellow members of the community.\n  - No excessive profanity, racism, sexism, or discriminatory language.\n  - Do not start disputes in-game or in discord, if there's an issue create a ticket accordingly.\n  - No hacking, bug abusing, or cheating.\n  - No stealing, trolling, or griefing.\n  - No offensive player names, tribe names, or creature names.\n  - A warning is a warning, regardless of the written rules. Rules are ultimately up to staff interpretation.\n  - Off-cluster currency/property (e.g. USD, Crypto, Steam keys, etc.) may not be used as part of any transaction.\n\nGeneral Rules\n  - Any mutated creature should NOT be given out for free, must be spayed/neutered, and sold or traded for a fair market price. This includes creatures that had their ancestry wiped via exploit.\n  - Do not leave any creatures outside your base, in the wild, or in/outside caves.\n  - When looting beaver dams make sure you take everything or discard unwanted items. This ensures they will respawn.\n  - Please keep your oil pumps, gas collectors, and sap taps unlocked for public use.\n  - Do not drop Wild Fertilized eggs if you do not want them, instead consume them.\n  - Do not interfere with other players Orbital Supply Drop's, Element Veins, or Titan battles. Please don't hog them either.\n  - Do not interfere with other players taming.\n\nBuild Rules - Base Guidelines\n  - Each tribe must not exceed 7,000 structures per map. Type `/structurelimit` in chat to see your total structure count for that map.\n  - Structure decay is 15 days (30 Sponsors).\n  - Each tribe is allowed a maximum of 3 base locations per map.\n  - Each tribe is allowed 5 Dino Terminal per map.\n  - Do not build large floating bases high up in the air.\n  - Do not build within 40 foundations of another player unless agreed upon.\n  - Extremely long Water Tank lines are not allowed. Use CS intakes. They don't need a water source to function.\n  - Do not build on player spawn points.\n  - No structure spamming to block spawns and/or to claim land. This includes outside your base.\n\nBuild Rules - Restrictions\n  - Ensure all explorer notes, obelisks, cave entrances, artifacts, runes, and charge nodes are accessible, do not block them. You may put structures down before you run the cave but remove it afterwards.\n  - Do not block or build in beaver dam spawns.\n  - Do not build within 25 foundations of resource rich areas.\n  - Clean up all traps once you have finished using them to prevent clutter. Unattended traps will be demolished on sight.\n  - Do not place any type of structure(s) to get across the map, to rich resource areas, or to a cave quicker, etc.\n\nBuild Rules - Server Specific\n  - No building on 'Carno Island' or 'Herb Island' on The Island.\n  - No blocking city terminals or city sky bridges on Extinction, please leave room.\n  - No blocking paths to other zones in Aberration.\n  - No blocking or building in tunnels that lead to the surface on Aberration.\n  - Do not build in space or in the tunnels that lead to space on Genesis 2.\n  - Do not block the eurypterid spawn on Ragnarok or the Black Pearl lake on Lost Island.\n  - Do not block underground ocean entrances or entrances into the underground cave system on Valguero.\n  - Do not block or build on \"glitch\" areas or teleportation zones on Genesis 1.\n\nMaps with A and B Variants\n  - Due to limited space for bases, some more popular maps will have multiple servers.\n  - To ensure this space is available to others, *players must choose either the \"A\" maps or the \"B\" maps cluster-wide.*\n\nMaps that match your choice above\n  - You may build, tribe-up, and play on these as normal.\n\n  Maps that differ from your choice above\n  - You may visit, sell items, and generally interact with other players.\n  - You must avoid the following:\n    - Building bases of any size\n    - Storing items, dinos, etc.\n    - Joining tribes\n\nMaps without multiple copies\n  - You may build, tribe-up, and play on these as normal.\n\nIn the future, these limits will be enforced automatically.\n  - \"A\" vs \"B\" will be selected based on existing ownership on each map, and structures, items, & dinos on the other copies will be destroyed on reboot.\n\nTame/Terminal Limits\n  - Each Tribe is allowed 5 Terminals per map.\n  - 1000 Dino Balls per Map.\n  - Map Limit is 50 Tames out per map."
